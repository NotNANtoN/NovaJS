 * A government ("gövt"): a collection of ships and planets that react

 * who a ship is allied with, who it fights, how skilled it is, and how much
 * inherent missile jamming it has.
 *
 * Field layout and semantics follow the EVN Bible's gövt section (pp. ~27-30)
 * and ResForge's 192-byte gövt template. Only the fields plausibly useful to
 * combat, reputation, and fleet behaviour are plumbed through here; the
 * remaining cosmetic/UI fields (comm name, target code, news picture, etc.)
 * are carried too so consumers don't have to re-parse.
