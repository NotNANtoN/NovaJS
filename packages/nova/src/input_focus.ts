// Tracks whether a text-entry surface currently owns the keyboard, so the
// browser's global control-event relay (browser.ts) can drop game hotkeys
// before they ever become control events. Without this, typing into a text
// field also fires document-level game controls — e.g. digits selecting
// stellar bodies, 'd' departing, 'm' opening the map — because the same
// keydown reaches both the field and the control relay.
//
// Two independent sources are tracked:
//   - PIXI text-entry modals (e.g. the starmap Find dialog) that are not real
//     DOM inputs: they register/unregister explicitly around their lifetime.
//   - Real HTML input overlays (title-screen dialogs, prompts, ...): detected
//     live from document.activeElement, so nothing has to register them.
//
// Suppression driven by this state is purely client-side and
// determinism-safe: the dropped events are never recorded as inputs, so no
// peer's simulation is affected (see novajs-determinism notes).
